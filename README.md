### Credit Card Fraud Detection using Logistic Regression

This project aims to detect fraudulent transactions in credit card data using a binary classification model. The dataset is highly imbalanced, with a small proportion of fraudulent transactions compared to legitimate ones. To address this imbalance, the model employs techniques such as downsampling and applies logistic regression for classification.

#### Key Features:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - The dataset was cleaned by checking for missing values and handling the class imbalance. Legitimate transactions were downsampled to match the number of fraudulent transactions, resulting in a balanced dataset for model training.

2. **Model Selection**:
   - A **Logistic Regression** model was selected for its interpretability and efficiency in binary classification tasks. The dataset was split into training and testing sets, ensuring stratification to maintain class distribution.

3. **Performance Metrics**:
   - The modelâ€™s performance was evaluated using **accuracy**, achieving 95.04% on the training set and 93.40% on the testing set.
   - Additional metrics such as **precision**, **recall**, **F1-score**, and a **confusion matrix** were computed to provide a deeper analysis of the model's ability to detect fraudulent transactions, especially in the context of class imbalance.
